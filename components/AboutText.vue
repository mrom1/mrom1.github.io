    <p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</p>
    <p>I'm a computer engineer from Germany.</p>
    <p>
      I have a passion for low-level coding, these days mostly in C++, in the
      past I worked in embedded software development for the German automotive
      industry, as well as in the field of visualization (Virtual Reality /
      OpenGL). Furthermore, I have a particular interest in security,
      cryptography, reverse engineering, and modern C++ concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately, I have been focusing more on topics like low-level networking,
      microservices, Internet of Things, and some front-end development mostly
      done with Vue.js.
